# pycorrfunc

> [!WARNING]
> This repo is a proof-of-concept and is not intended for public use.

A pythonic rewrite of the software infrastructure surrounding Corrfunc. The same internals and performance, but improved packaging.

In particular, the primary goal is to get wheels working with true runtime SIMD dispatch.

Based on the summer project of Peter McMaster, advised by Lehman Garrison.
